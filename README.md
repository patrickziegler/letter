# :memo: letter

Need to quickly write a letter but you don't have LaTeX installed anymore because your university days are long over?
Look no further! This is for you :relieved:

## Usage

Simply update your address in `document.tex`, write your letter in `content/letter.tex` and type `make` to see the result :tada:

**Pro tip**: If you are unfortunate and don't have [Okular](https://okular.kde.org) on your system, just use `make pdf` instead.
